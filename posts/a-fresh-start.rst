A fresh start
=============

Hi everyone. I have decided to move away from Wordpress.com, whom I thank for hosting my previous blog for the past 2 years. But, as I am moving forward with my journey to AWS and cloud in general, I wanted to start using more of the AWS'someness.

A while ago, I started a blog using Nikola, which I am using again today to generate all the future blog articles and guides/how-to's and host it directly in S3.

Where are the old posts ?
-------------------------

Some of the very old articles I have are still in my Github account, therefore I will simply republish them, probably in the archives part.


For the most recent AWS or Eucalyptus articles, they will simply be re-published here very soon :)
